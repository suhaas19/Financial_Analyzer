Used Python, GenAi To Analyse my expenditures 
🚀 AI-Powered Financial Analyzer: Unlocking Insights into Savings & Expenditures

Managing personal finances effectively requires clear insights into income, spending patterns, and savings trends. To tackle this, I developed a Financial Analyzer that utilizes LLM-powered analysis, Python, and visualization tools to process and interpret transaction data.



How It Works:



🔹 Data Collection & Processing: Extracted and cleaned two years of AmEx transaction data.

🔹 LLM-Powered Categorization: Fine-tuned Llama 3 to automatically classify transactions (Income, Investments, Utilities, Travel, etc.).

🔹 Dashboard Visualization: Built an interactive dashboard in Python (Matplotlib, NetworkX) to display trends in monthly income, expenses, and savings rate.

🔹 Expense Breakdown & Savings Insights: Identifies where money is spent, highlights saving patterns, and suggests areas for optimization.



How I Used LLMs for Categorizing Financial Data:



🔹 Fine-Tuning Llama 3: Adjusted model weights and temperature to specialize in transaction classification.

🔹 Custom Training: Trained the model on labeled financial data (ex: categorizing transactions into Income, Investments, Taxes, Utilities, Travel, etc.).

🔹 Prompt Engineering & Optimization: Designed structured prompts to guide the LLM in making accurate expense classifications.

🔹 Reducing Hallucinations: Used temperature control and model filtering to improve the accuracy of financial insights.

🔹 Iterative Model Improvement: Analyzed misclassified transactions and fine-tuned the model further using real financial transaction logs.



What I Learned About LLMs & AI Agents:

✅ LLMs are powerful for context-based financial data interpretation.

✅ Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over generic models.

✅ Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in structuring financial insights.

✅ AI can automate financial intelligence, reducing manual categorization efforts.



Why This Matters?

📊 Track Expenses Efficiently – Understand where your money goes each month.

💰 Optimize Savings – Identify spending habits and adjust for financial goals.

🔍 Data-Driven Decisions – Move beyond spreadsheets and let AI analyze financial patterns dynamically.

This project has been a great learning experience in AI-driven financial analytics, and I look forward to expanding it with predictive insights & investment tracking!

Would love to hear from others exploring LLMs in financial intelligence. Let’s connect! 🔥
